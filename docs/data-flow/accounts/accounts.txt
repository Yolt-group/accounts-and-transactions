How is the account tables in the accounts keyspace filled?
===

The account table is filled by two paths:

1. http calls from this (accounts_and_transactions) service
2. writes from the aggregation pod, the aggregation pod writes directly to the accounts keyspace based on data in the datascience keyspace

                                                                accounts keyspace
